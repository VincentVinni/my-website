                        Hi my name is Vincent! I'm a fourth year Computer Science student at UC Berkeley. 
                        I'm an avid learner and problem solver who enjoys the intersection of artifical intelligence, machine learning, and software development with 
                        real life entrepreneurship. In my spare time you will probably find me in the gym, playing chess or catching up on a good
