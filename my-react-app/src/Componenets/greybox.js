                I'm a fourth year Computer Science student at UC Berkeley. 
                I'm an avid learner and problem solver who enjoys the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and software development with 
                real life entrepreneurship. In my spare time you will most likely find me in the gym, playing chess or catching up on a good 
                Netflix thriller series!
